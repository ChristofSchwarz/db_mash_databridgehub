# data/\bridge Deployment Hub

The Deployment Hub gives Qlik Sense Developers some highly needed options around app lifecycle management:

 - Refresh components of an app from __another app__ or file 
   * script
   * data
   * design
   * or any combination 
   * or all at once 
 - Upload app to a stream
 - Rename app
 - Duplicate app
 - Quick info about the datamodel (table names, #Rows, #Fields)
 - Quick-view of the load script

# Known limitations
 - Enigma doesn't start when you use a virtual proxy with header authentication (and a browser addon like HeaderMod) 
 - Assumes that roles "ContentAdmin" and "RootAdmin" have not been manipulated in the Security Rules
